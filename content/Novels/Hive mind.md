*The world isn't as it used to be. It was possible to know when someone wasn't listening. When their mind was elsewhere or they were on their phones. I was still old enough to remember my dad reaching for his phone when he needed information. Just google it. I remember how angry my mum used to get when he'd get up to answer a business call during family dinner.*
Torna sat in her office chair, her eyes slits of concentration. She sits in front of a desk enclosed in a cubicle. The desk is bare except for a paper thin monitor which spanned the entire length of the desk. The side of Tornas head illuminated with green light indicating that her Neural Net was interfacing with the computer. The word editor which was open on the monitor had text spiralling across it at a rate that no touch typer could dream to do. Blood flows from Tornas nose and she breaks connection with her computer. 
*Fuck this is still happening*, she thinks. 
For the past few months, her Neural Net version 3 had been glitching causing massive headaches and nose bleeds with extended use. This model is now about 3 years out of date with the latest. It has been 10 years since Neuramatter released their first iteration of the brain computer chip - a chip comprised of biological liveware that, once installed into the nervous system, allows the user to interface with compatible technologies. It didn't take long before cars, phones, computers, vending machines, ATMs, TVs, gaming consoles and many more were able to be controlled with a Neural Net brain chip. 
Torna gets up from her office chair and enters the office of her superior, Mike. Mike is facing away from her on his office chair talking to the wall, hearing her comes in, spins around and holds up a finger asking her to wait until he finishes his call. His iris completely white indicating that while he sees her, his brain chip is visualising the caller on the other end of the line. Torna raises her hand to her temple and hunches over in pain. Unabashed by the apparent distress of his employee, Mike continues to talk as if he hasn't noticed anything. Finally, a few moments later he directs his attention to Torna.
"What is it now Torna, we're very busy as you know" 
"My Neural Net is giving me trouble again, I don't think I can continue working today" she says with her jaw clenched 
Mike chuckles, "Well, as I've told you in my last email, the company is willing to subsidise an upgrade to the latest Neural Net. You really should take us up on that. I can't begin to tell you how much better it is."
Torna pauses for a moment and says "You know why I'm not willing to do that"
"I remember you saying. Regardless, this can't continue. Either get that thing fixed or don't bother coming back". Mike spins back around on his chair and continues talking to the wall. Torna goes back to her desk and switches off the monitor before heading to the elavator. As she steps in, the light on the side of her temple goes green and Torna visualises *ground floor*. The elevator closes its doors and begins to go down at a rapid but controlled speed.
