# Chapter 1  
  
*We have always been too smart for our own good. Technology we develop fast our brains stagnate. Human neurology has not changed for thousands of years. Yet, we have the technology of gods. The power to end worlds.*   
  
  
*In my early childhood, we processed information the natural way. Our technology was limited by how fast we could search something up. The data stream from knowledge to mind was mediated through our fingertips.*   
  
  
*Technology has always come in waves. There'll be nothing and then, before you know it, the world is a completely different place. You used to reach for your phone, like a reflex: "Just google it". It became a phantom limb. My mum would get furious at my dad when he would get up and answer a business call at family dinner, or to look something up.*  
  
  
*There's a lot less talking now. It just isn't necessary. I suppose that started to fade out a long time ago - but there's less of it now. I was in the car on my way to my first year of highschool when I first heard about Neauralmatter. My friend excitedly sent me a link:*  
  
  
***BREAKING! Neuralmatter set to release Neural-Net V1 on 13th May 2031:***  
  
  
***The Neuralmatter has passed its 3rd round of human testing and has been approved by FDA for public release. Neuralmatter was the first company to discover liveware. A synthetic programmable living tissue that can extend human cognition.***  
  
  
  
*At the time, I didn't think much of it. There had been plenty of claims in the past that a new piece of technology would change everything. But, it never really did. Nothing drastic. Who would want to have something foreign in their skull.*  
  
  
*I'll never forget the day I walked into my high-school's common room and saw a crowd. I pushed my way through and joined some friends at the front. There was one of the rich kids in the middle, he had a satisfied smile on his face.*  
  
  
*"Show us what it does" cheered a boy, the crowd rallied.*  
  
  
*The boy looked the TV mounted on the wall, the heads of the crowd followed. Nothing happened, but then the TV pixelated and turned black.*   
  
  
*The TV turned on, except, it wasn't showing the same picture it had before. A video played showing the faces of the people in the crowd. The boy smiled, the TV sparked and caught flame. The crowd cheered but dispersed when the fire alarm blared.*  
  
  
*I went home that day and begged my parents to get one. They said we couldn't spare the credits. I knew we couldn't but it still hurt. Within a couple years, half my classmates had a Neural Net. Teachers allowed them free periods since they could download the course material. The rest of us had to study, the old fashioned way. I got my first Neural Net when i was 18. It's only a day surgery and doesn't leave any marks. A robotic surgeon is the only way it can be installed.*  
  
  
Torna sat in her office chair, her were eyes slits of concentration. She sat in front of a desk enclosed in a cubicle. The desk was bare, except for a paper thin monitor which stretched across the desk. The side of Tornas' head was illuminated in green light indicating that her Neural Net was interfacing with the computer. The word editor was open on the monitor and had text running down at rapid speeds. Her hands sat upon her lap in fists.   
  
  
Torna winced, blood flowed from her nose. There was a quiet beep and the light on her temple turned from green to red.   
  
  
*Fuck this is still happening. I only just had this stupid thing fixed. I cant afford this right now*  
  
  
Torna's Neural Net 3 years old and outdated. It had been a decade since Neuramatter changed society as it was. A chip comprised of biological liveware that once installed into the nervous system allowed the user to interface with compatible technologies. It's initial release saw havoc unleashed upon society. At first, there were cases of ATM hacking - it wasn't long before smart cars were driving off roads with passengers onboard. In order to be on the same playing field, the government needed to employ its own liveware. Neuramatter became the leading tech company in the world.   
  
  
But, it was discovered that Neural Nets had a design flaw. It was a risk to upgrade a Neural Net. For some a neural Net could become so integrated brain, the tendrils of the liveware would be so deeply tangled in their brain that upgrading would be fatal.  
  
  
Torna stood up and walked to her manager's office. The door was closed, she gave three raps with her knuckle. She heard no response but slowly opened the door. Mike was seated and facing away from the door - talking to the wall. He turned his head in her direction, span around and held up a finger to her. Torna could see his iris was completely white. Mike continued to chuckle and talk.   
  
  
Torna raised her hand to her temple. She wanted to hunch over in pain. Mike finished said goodbye to his caller and the light on the side of his head went red. He turned to face Torna and said:  
  
  
"What is it now Torna, we're very busy."   
  
  
"My Neural Net is giving me trouble again. I don't know if I can keep working today, Sir." she said through clenched teeth.    
  
  
Mike put on a smile riddled with condescension.   
  
  
"The company will pay for another. You can't just keep missing work like this."  
  
  
Torna paused for a moment, "You know that I can't. I can't risk it. I've got my daughter to think about."  
  
  
"The doctors don't know what they're talking about. I upgrade all the time."    
  
  
"I can't, sir."  
  
  
"Well, It won't matter anyway. My father is retiring soon. I wouldn't get comfortable here", he chuckled.  
  
  
Mike swiveled back around on his chair and resumed his call - he held up a hand and waved Torna away. Torna stormed back to her desk and switched off the monitor before heading to the elevator. The elevator doors opened and Torna stepped in. The light on the side of her temple went green and Torna visualised the words *ground floor*. The elevator doors closed and descended.  
  
  
*What am I going to do? I cant risk losing my job, I've got Jaj to think of. There's no time to feel sorry for myself*.  
  
  
Torna's head pounded, she gripped the railing and held her head. The elevator slowed to a stop and dinged.   
  
  
Torna stepped out onto the bustling street of a future city, a city pulsating with life and technology. The noise of the city was suffocating. Foot traffic was shoulder to shoulder.The pedestrian heads glowed green and red, casting long shadows on the grimy footpath.  Skyscrapers enveloped the city, their steel frames obscured by neon advertisements that flickered with hypnotic intensity. Hovercars emblazoned with various corporate logos zoomed overhead, shrouded in the fog chocked skyline. The air was wet with an acrid stench of industrial pollution and poverty - creating a nauseating cocktail.   
  
  
Torna trudged along the cracked pavement. She stepped heavy with exhaustion. The thought of seeing her child at home spurred her to life. She closed her eyes and the light turned green. A holographic display flickered to life and she opened her eyes. Torna selected the icon for a personal taxi service - the display stuttered and froze. Torna continued to select with frustration, the display refused to respond to her commands. After a few futile attempts, the holograph responded: *Economy Taxi ETA 5 minutes for a fee of 30 credits.*  
  
  
Torna arrived at her apartment complex. The  and pressed her finger to the scanner. The door buzzed open
