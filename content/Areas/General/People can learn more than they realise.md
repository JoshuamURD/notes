Adult brains are highly adaptable, not just children's brains. Since the 1990's brain researchers have seen increasingly that adult brains are far more adaptable than previously imagined. The brain is not a set of fixed wiring after adulthood. New connections can be made between neurons and existing ones can be strengthened or weakened. It is even possible for new neurons to grow. It no longer makes sense to think of people with having a fixed reserve of potential that cannot be expanded. Potential can be cultivated and new limits can be reached with the right learning practices.
