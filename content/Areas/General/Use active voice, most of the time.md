Passive voice is when you have an adjective or adverb do something to the subject of the sentence (the noun).   
  
An example of passive voice is "the car was driven by John". If the sentence is about John, he should be the doer of the verb: "John drove the car".   
  
A good way to identify the passive voice is usually the presence of a compound verb like "was driven".
