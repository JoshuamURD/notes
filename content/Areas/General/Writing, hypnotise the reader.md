Writing works best when it hypnotises the reader. It creates a spell where they see another world, the world you created. The goal of the writer is to keep the reader as spellbound as possible. Avoid distractions and boredom that can cause their attention to wander. This spell can be broken when the reader can see through the writer. When the writer overuses cliches and trite expressions. Instead of an original oil, the writer is giving a paint by the number.
