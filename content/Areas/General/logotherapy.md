Logotherapy focuses on the future, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future. It is a meaning-centred psychotherapy. Victor Frankl developed logotherapy. The philosophy of the therapy proposes that a person's search for meaning is their primary motivation of their life and not a "secondary rationalization" as a product of instinctual drives. It is described that mental health is a tension between what one has already achieved and what one believes they ought to become.
