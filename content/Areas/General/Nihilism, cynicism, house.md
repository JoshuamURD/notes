I'm watching house for the second time. House is a Nihilistic, cynical doctor who views patients as more of a puzzle than a human being. He won't take on a case unless it's sufficiently complex enough to be interesting for him. It's an interesting premise to have in a doctor for a tv show, but is it all together unreasonable that he's come to this view? It would be highly confronting to work in the medical industry. Doctors are constantly reminded that, at the end of the day, on the physical level we are no more than blood and bones and meat. Even while watching the show, I feel a sense of discomfort at the scenes showing the operations. I've wondered myself whether that comes from seeing blood, or is it something else. I've never felt uncomfortable about blood, so that can't be it. Upon closer inspection, I feel like it makes me uncomfortable because it's a gruelling reminder of our underlying components. Whether or not we are more than the sum of our parts can never be confirmed - at least not in this lifetime. We like to think that we are special, some of us need to think that to continue to live. It's also the cause of many of societies problems. Thinking that the individual is paramount because every individual is special. Seeing blood and guts and gore remind us that underneath all the ego and identity, it's just a bunch of meat.
