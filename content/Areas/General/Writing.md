# Writing  
Writing is one of those skills where it's hard to say what exactly makes it good. Who can truly be an authority on good writing? I'm sure that you could say good writing is writing which sells. However, this is not always the case. There are plenty of well written stories and novels which have gone unnoticed.   
  
I think good writing is engaging to its intended audience. It communicates ideas effectively. Having comprehensive wielding of English grammar and style. Analogising the complex and figuratively speaking the unspeakable.   
  
I'd like to get better at writing and have dedicated some of my time to researching some common techniques by well wrote people.   
  
A very common technique in good writing is to write simply. Making sure that each word is worth its space on the page.
