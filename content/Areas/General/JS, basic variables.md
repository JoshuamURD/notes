Javascript has variables declared by using the `let` keyword. For example:  
```javascript  
let a=1;  
```  
  
Any time you declare a variable, you should have a semicolon at the end of the line.  
  
## Updating values in a variable  
you can update a variable by using the equals sign:  
```javascript  
let score=5;  
score=score+5;  
```  
  
You can also use `+=` to increment a value.  
  
## Old way of making variables  
You can see in some old tutorials that they use `var` to declare variables instead of `let`. It still works but it is an outdated syntax.
