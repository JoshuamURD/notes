I enjoy the learning about learning (so meta). It's seems to be a skill that isn't taught as a common practice. There a many common misconceptions about learning. Learning is best done when it is challenging and when it requires revisiting information. This is how I've set up my note-taking workflow. I revisit information and find possible links with what I already know, with the help of AI.
