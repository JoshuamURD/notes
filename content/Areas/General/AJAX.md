AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript And XML.  
It allows for background requests for the server, such as scrolling to the bottom of a page and having new posts be loaded.  
  
It essentially makes requests AFTER the page has been loaded. Instead of a request having the entire page reload (where the server sends HTML, CSS and Javascript) it sends an AJAX.  
  
AJAX makes requests to APIs.
