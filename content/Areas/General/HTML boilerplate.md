```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>test</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```
The above is the HTML boilerplate. It is the base document each html file should have.
- DOCTYPE indicates to the browser that we are usign HTML5
- head contains metadata that won't be shown on the webpage
- body contains all the tags that will show on the webpage, all the content

VS Code has a shortcut to quickly put in the boilerplate by typing an exclamation mark and then hitting tab.
