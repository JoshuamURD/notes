```html  
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
	<title>test</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
</body>  
</html>  
```  
The above is the HTML boilerplate. It is the base document each html file should have.  
- DOCTYPE indicates to the browser that we are usign HTML5  
- head contains metadata that won't be shown on the webpage  
- body contains all the tags that will show on the webpage, all the content  
  
VS Code has a shortcut to quickly put in the boilerplate by typing an exclamation mark and then hitting tab.
