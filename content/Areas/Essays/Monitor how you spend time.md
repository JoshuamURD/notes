Summary::  
It's good to always be doing something you want to be doing at all times. You should be choosing your life. I don't mean that as you should never be doing something tedious. But if that tedious task is a necessity towards a greatly coveted goal, then you should take pride in what you're doing. If you cannot, take this pride, you should evaluate your goals. Why dont they feel worth pursuing, worth suffering for? Because all life has in it, its necessary sufferings whether instant or delayed in any action you are conducting that is within your control. Be goal oriented but not goal governed.
