Summary::
To lose weight just stop eating breakfast for a while and get used ti being hungry again. It won't be uncomfortable for long. Then move to stopping eating as soon as that uncomfy hunger is gone and eat realllyyyy slow with water in between. No take out and minimal drinking. 

For people, talking to them pretend they are the most interesting person ever and act internally like you really want to know all these things. Conjure that feeling and discuss them and whatever they're talking about like it's really interesting. At the same time, have in your head that you look really attractive and if anyone disagrees they're just crazy

Update: it's working. I've not been eating breakfast. A wrap or two for lunch with no butter and low cal wrap. And healthy dinner. I've been losing heaps of weight and never been happier. Starting to believe that vaping causes depression for me. It's been so long since I've felt so motivated and happy. Keep this up for your own mental health. Don't vape for your own mental health.

My biggest issue for the past few years has been self respect. I've not treated myself with respect which has resulted in a loss of confidence and poor decision making. To make matters worse, i slowly picked up more and more unhealthy habits during this time. I've been vaping, using drugs as a crutch and excessive drinking at events in order to function socially. I did this to feel better or numb my senses enough to function but ironically they furthered the problem by developing a habit of treating my body badly. As my weight goes down and as I can continue to rely on myself to lose weight and not vape, I'm developing more confidence. If I want this cycle to continue or if I ever come back to this note feeling lost, trust me when I say that it all starts with quitting nicotine. You can't have that form of instant and detrimental gratification all the time. You're not strong enough to constantly gratify and reliably do what you need to for your mental health. You, like everyone, are limited and this is your limit. Once you quit, you're pretty unstoppable at quitting other stuff cause you're quick learner. Next thing to do is your eating. Once you eat right you lose weight. Start missing a meal and then start having less in each meal. Do this until you reach your desired weight.
