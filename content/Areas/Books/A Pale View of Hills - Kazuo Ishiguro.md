# A Pale View of Hills
I'm 140 pages in and I still don't know exactly how to describe what A Pale View of Hills is about. It's set in postwar Japan just outside Nagasaki and goes between an undisclosed more modern day and the a few years or so after WWII has ended. The protagonist is a woman named Etsuko. It mostly spends time describing the lonely days she spent during the period just after the war. She lives with her husband, who is often too busy for her, in isolated but new apartment blocks which has a wasteland surrounding it (to the irritation of her and her neighbours). The author writes in a beautifully simple way and has mastered the ability of communicating dialogue without any adverbs or exclamation. Each piece of dialogue communicates the emotion of what is said through the choice of words - which creates an amazing flow that allows the reader to fill in through intuitive contextual understanding
