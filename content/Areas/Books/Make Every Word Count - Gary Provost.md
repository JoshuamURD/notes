# Make Every Word Count  
I particularly like one of the idea that Provost highlights in this book: that any topic of writing can be interesting if it's well written. As examples, he copies excerpts from two books on the same subject, one of them written so anyone could understand and another in textbook format. Both writing convey the same lessons and ideas but one of them is far more interesting and engaging by utilising writing technique and style. I would really like to be able to develop this ability. To be able to discuss even what may be widely considered an uninteresting niche topic But convey it in such a way that is highly engaging.
