# The Fellowship of the Ring  
  
I was told by my Dad that the lord of the rings book was disappointing in comparison to the films. I'm a big fan of the films and have always been curious myself on whether the books lived up to their film counterpart. So far I've not been disappointed. The fellowship of the ring, like the movie, focuses on Frodo's acquirement of the task of bearing the One Ring. A ring constructed of malice of the Lord of the Rings' Big Bad (Sauron). I really like Tolkein's prose. It's provably my favourite at the time of writing this. It flows so nicely and although they are filled with adjectives and long sentences, his use of punctuation to break up its flow is very nice to read.
