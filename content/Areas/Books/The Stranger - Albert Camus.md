# The Stranger  
The Stranger is novel which depicts a character who acts absurdly much like the idea of the absurd described in Albert Camus [The Myth of Sisyphus - Albert Camus](./The%20Myth%20of%20Sisyphus%20-%20Albert%20Camus.md). The main character is an ordinary man who acts indifferently to the world around him. Until by a whim, he kills a man. He continues with his indifference throughout the trial - even though he was likely to get a lesser sentence had he just shown remorse. The trial judge in particular is baffled by his indifference. He resents the main character for being guilty but being unable to render him guilty of conscience. While there is definitely no desire to act as the main character of this book, it does demonstrate that behavioural and societal constructs are ridiculous - or absurd, as Albert Camus would put it. There is no reason for the happenings of most things in that book (and an allegory to life in general) and the main character's indifference to that lack of meaning is what is so jarring to both the reader and the other characters in the book.
