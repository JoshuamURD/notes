# The Left Hand Of Darkness

The Left Hand of Darkness is a book which describes an alien planet where its dominant race is without specific gender. The planet is a desolate icy wasteland with very few mammals besides the humanoid species. Ursla uses this setting to dissect gender stereotypes and blur the lines of masculinity and femininity. It shows creatures which are biologically without gender or sexual desire (except for one part of the month) and how this has affected their society.
