Taoism uses Koans which are parabols or stories with underlying messages to teach their beliefs. They say that these stories don't appear to make sense at first but are designed to awaken your underlying presence. I think an interesting takeaway from this is that they propose that the meaning of life can't necessarily be taught, or at least, not outright said. I believe there is merit in this. How can there be a way to express the best way of living to another person? How can you know their way is your way? This has to be discovered for one's self. There needs to be dedicated time to reflection and self discovery. If this time can't be made, you're forced to either reside to someone else's belief or religion, or you just feel unhappy. There's something only you can discover, and that may only work for you, but it's worth discovering. To do this, like any other skill, it requires [Deliberate practice](../General/Deliberate%20practice.md). You need to spend time working it. The Taoists use Koans as a way of getting you puzzling over things. Why does that story sound so unusual? Take this one for example:  
  
> **When both hands are clapped a sound is produced; listen to the sound of one hand clapping**.  
  
  
This is a koan. It doesn't try to tell you what the meaning of life is. It doesn't try to itemise good living practices. It just says, take this question or story: what of it? For most, it'll be nonsensical. It's said that a true Taoist will find Koans like that humorous. Alan Watts said: two Taoists don't need introduction when crossing each other on the road, just like two thieves need not know one from the other.
