I already collect a fair amount data on myself. I collect my workouts on Hevy, I collect my eating habits on MacroFactor, I will start collecting my step and sleep data on fitbit. I wonder if there's a cool way I can automate putting these items into a database to be displayed on a website with insights. Whether I'm losing weight, why i might not be losing weight. Whether my sleep is good.
