I've been using obsidian for a few years now. I should design a template for school use and one for personal use. I should put these templates for free on this website. Make it instantly demonstrable how a notetaking system pays off. A place for ideas to grow. For learning to become structured.   
  
I should post the vaults on reddit and link to my site when I've gone through it thoroughly.
