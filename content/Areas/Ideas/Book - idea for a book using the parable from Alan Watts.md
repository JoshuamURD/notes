# idea  
A book about a future where humanity is able to enter a "God mode". In this mode they transcend reality. They are able to manipulate the laws of physics and matter at their whim. However in this transcended state, they can't experience things with anyone. There's no ability to talk in inter-experiencial reality. Experiences don't touch the soul as they used to. Eventually, they discover that experience was the point all along
