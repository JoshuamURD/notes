An essay on why so many philosophers all over the globe without any connection to each other or means of sharing ideas were still able to manifest this idea of connectedness. That there is some form of connection beyond what can be seen. A collective unconscious. Is there an explainable reason for why rhese people were able to have shared ideas? Why so many religions with similar features were created across the globe before globalization? Is there a shared unconscious and a connectedness more than what meets the eye?
