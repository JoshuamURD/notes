Make a Web app that facilitates Web building. It'd essentially be specialised database software. Useful for hobbyist world builders, writers and RPG enthusiasts.   
You could create:  
- characters with details about them such as back story, race, affiliates  
- towns, places, continents  
- items  
  
It would allow linking between all the different nodes and various query views to generate tables showing related content.  
  
Have integrated ai to assist with ideas  
  
Maybe I could even try making it as a tiddlywiki template
