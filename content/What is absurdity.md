Summary::

What is absurd? 
What is absurd? First it would appear that we need to study what is reasonable and what is rational. Words are merely resonations from the vocal cords or attributed meaning to scribbles on a page. That is to say, the meaning of a phrase is primarily given by its author or by its colloquial. Relevantly, Oxford dictionary defines absurd to mean wildly unreasonable, illogical or inappropriate as it's primary meaning. It can be seen from this and from commentary by Albert Camus in the Myth of Sisyphus that absurdity has a precondition that an object (that be a person or inanimate) be at least one of: 
• Unreasonable;
• Irrational (inappropriate); 
• Illogical; or
• A combination of the above.
What is reasonable? 
Reasonable by definition (Oxford dictionary) states that it can mean to have "sound judgement; fair and sensible". However this does little to clarify exactly what that might mean. Having "sound judgement" is a phrase which is riddled with social bias. After all, to be able to determine whether judgement is sound requires an exercise of determining, as the definition states, what is fair and sensible. However, what is fair and sensible may depend on various factors such as cultural biases, political views and philosophical stances. If there is one thing that someone who exercises logic on its faculties would know: there is no clear answer as to what is the sensible and fair. If it were the case that everyone were imbued with an inherit understanding of either, there can't have reasonably been any wars or holocaust or any other abominations of suffering. How could we suffer if we were to already know that it was for a "reasonable" reason which is fair and sensible? So, where does that leave us on what is reasonable? Perhaps it suggests a subjective exercise, which is to say,  what you may do is within your own reason by may be outside that of others in the same exercise over the same set facts in determining what is fair or sensible. This contradicts Kant's application of universal law which generates categorical imperative 


What is rational? How is the same as a "appropriate"?

What is logic?


Reduce screen time and especially watching time as much as possible. The netflix, binge, stan and other streaming services switch off your brain. Only use YouTube for educational or the ocassional TV show episode while smoking or watch with family to make it a social event.
