“mental representations.” They’re not random; they mean something, and meaning aids memory. Similarly, chess masters don’t develop some incredible memory for where individual pieces sit on a board. Instead, their memory is very context-dependent: it is only for patterns of the sort that would appear in a normal game

 A mental representation is a mental structure that corresponds to an object, an idea, a collection of information, or anything else, concrete or abstract, that the brain is thinking about

but in essence these representations are preexisting patterns of information—facts, images, rules, relationships, and so on—that are held in long-term memory and that can be used to respond quickly and effectively in certain types of situations

how well your mental representations allow you to overcome the limitations of short-term memory and retain what you are reading.


Studies have shown that the key factor determining a person’s comprehension of a story about a football or baseball game is how much that person already understands about the sport.
The reason is straightforward: If you don’t know much about the sport, then all of the details you read are essentially a bunch of unrelated facts, and remembering them is not much easier than remembering a list of random words. But if you understand the sport, you’ve already established a mental structure for making sense of it,

Purposeful practice has well-defined, specific goals.

You seldom improve much without giving the task your full attention

Purposeful practice involves feedback

Recent studies have shown that learning a new skill is much more effective at triggering structural changes in the brain than simply continuing to practice a skill that one has already learned. On the other hand, pushing too hard for too long can lead to burnout and ineffective learning

pushed outside—but not too far outside—its comfort zone.
 


The fact that the human brain and body respond to challenges by developing new abilities underlies the effectiveness of purposeful and deliberate practice.

researchers who carried out the study on the size of that part of the brain in mathematicians and nonmathematicians found that the longer someone had worked as a mathematician, the more gray matter he or she had in the right inferior parietal lobule—which would suggest that the increased size was a product of extended mathematical thinking, not something the person was born with.


Although the specific details vary from skill to skill, the overall pattern is consistent: Regular training leads to changes in the parts of the brain that are challenged by the training

At present no one knows what the practical implications of this are, but, generally speaking, more white matter leads to nerve signals being transmitted more quickly, so it seems likely that practicing the piano as a child will lead to certain neurological advantages that you just can’t match with practice as an adult.

With deliberate practice, however, the goal is not just to reach your potential but to build it, to make things possible that were not possible before. This requires challenging homeostasis—getting out of your comfort zone—and forcing your brain or your body to adapt
