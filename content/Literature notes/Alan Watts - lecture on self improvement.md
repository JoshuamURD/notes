- The reason you want to be better is the reason you aren't- [[Alan watts]] youtube lecture
	- Doing good can be incredibly destructive because it's full of conceit. How do you know what's best for someone else? How do you even know what's best for you?
	- Beware of perceived virtue
	- Lao Tzu says that the highest virtue is no virtue which really is virtue
	- That is to say, real virtue calls no attention to itself or declares itself as one. It is self integrated.
