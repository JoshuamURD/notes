# Notes
# On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft
##### Stephen King

## Chapter 1
### Page 87 @ 29 April 2024 11:31:41 AM
*“When you write a story, you’re telling yourself the story,” he said. “When you rewrite, your main job is taking out all the things that are not the story.”*

### Page 124 @ 29 April 2024 06:26:47 PM
*The most important is that the writer’s original perception of a character or characters may be as erroneous as the reader’s. Running a close second was the realization that stopping a piece of work just because it’s hard, either emotionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea. Sometimes you have to go on when you don’t feel like it, and sometimes you’re doing good work when it feels like all you’re managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.*

## Chapter 2 What Writing Is
### Page 174 @ 29 April 2024 10:57:23 PM
*We’ve engaged in an act of telepathy. No mythy-mountain shit; real telepathy.*

writing is telepathy across space and time

*Come to it any way but lightly. Let me say it again: you must not come lightly to the blank page.*

approach writing with the intent of engaged and meaningful work

## Chapter 3 Toolbox
### Page 187 @ 30 April 2024 12:43:05 PM
*Put your vocabulary on the top shelf of your toolbox, and don’t make any conscious effort to improve it. (You’ll be doing that as you read, of course … but that comes later.) One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you’re maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones.*

### Page 188 @ 30 April 2024 12:44:10 PM
*Remember that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful. If you hesitate and cogitate, you will come up with another word—of course you will, there’s always another word—but it probably won’t be as good as your first one, or as close to what you really mean.*

### Page 188 @ 30 April 2024 12:44:40 PM
*The word is only a representation of the meaning; even at its best, writing almost always falls short of full meaning.*

### Page 192 @ 30 April 2024 03:41:30 PM
*Nouns and verbs are the two indispensable parts of writing. Without one of each, no group of words can be a sentence, since a sentence is, by definition, a group of words containing a subject (noun) and a predicate (verb);*

*you want to refurbish your grammar, go to your local used-book store and find a copy of Warriner’s English Grammar and Composition*

### Page 196 @ 30 April 2024 09:12:05 PM
*Verbs come in two types, active and passive. With an active verb, the subject of the sentence is doing something. With a passive verb, something is being done to the subject of the sentence. The subject is just letting it happen. You should avoid the passive tense.*

### Page 201 @ 30 April 2024 09:52:50 PM
*I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs, and I will shout it from the rooftops.*

### Page 202 @ 30 April 2024 09:54:27 PM
*can be a good sport about adverbs, though. Yes I can. With one exception: dialogue attribution. I insist that you use the adverb in dialogue attribution only in the rarest and most special of occasions … and not even then, if you can avoid it*

### Page 204 @ 01 May 2024 12:42:00 PM
*The best form of dialogue attribution is said, as in he said, she said, Bill said, Monica said.*

### Page 212 @ 02 May 2024 06:16:12 PM
*Topic-sentence-followed-by-support-and-description insists that the writer organize his/her thoughts, and it also provides good insurance against wandering away from the topic.*

### Page 213 @ 02 May 2024 06:17:07 PM
*In fiction, the paragraph is less structured—it’s the beat instead of the actual melody.*

### Page 217 @ 02 May 2024 06:35:50 PM
*A series of grammatically proper sentences can stiffen that line, make it less pliable. Purists hate to hear that and will deny it to their dying breath, but it’s true. Language does not always have to wear a tie and lace-up shoes*

## Chapter 4 On Writing
### Page 231 @ 02 May 2024 07:07:28 PM
*If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There’s no way around these two things that I’m aware of, no shortcut.*

### Page 247 @ 02 May 2024 07:26:08 PM
*I like to get ten pages a day, which amounts to 2,000 words. That’s 180,000 words over a three-month span, a goodish length for a book—something in which the reader can get happily lost, if the tale is done well and stays fresh*

### Page 255 @ 02 May 2024 10:59:38 PM
*think you begin by interpreting “write what you know” as broadly and inclusively as possible. If you’re a plumber, you know plumbing, but that is far from the extent of your knowledge; the heart also knows things, and so does the imagination. Thank God. If not for heart and imagination, the world of fiction would be a pretty seedy place. It might not even exist at all*

### Page 260 @ 03 May 2024 12:45:31 PM
*Write what you like, then imbue it with life and make it unique by blending in your own personal knowledge of life, friendship, relationships, sex, and work.*

### Page 264 @ 03 May 2024 12:50:07 PM
*I distrust plot for two reasons: first, because our lives are largely plotless, even when you add in all our reasonable precautions and careful planning; and second, because I believe plotting and the spontaneity of real creation aren’t compatible.*

### Page 266 @ 03 May 2024 12:51:52 PM
*Plot is, I think, the good writer’s last resort and the dullard’s first choice. The story which results from it is apt to feel artificial and labored.*

### Page 266 @ 03 May 2024 12:52:04 PM
*lean more heavily on intuition, and have been able to do that because my books tend to be based on situation rather than story*

### Page 267 @ 03 May 2024 12:52:43 PM
*My job isn’t to help them work their way free, or manipulate them to safety—those are jobs which require the noisy jackhammer of plot—but to watch what happens and then write it down.*

### Page 267 @ 03 May 2024 12:53:04 PM
*The situation comes first. The characters—always flat and unfeatured, to begin with—come next. Once these things are fixed in my mind, I begin to narrate. I often have an idea of what the outcome may be, but I have never demanded of a set of characters that they do things my way. On the contrary, I want them to do things their way.*

### Page 285 @ 04 May 2024 10:11:51 AM
*Thin description leaves the reader feeling bewildered and nearsighted. Overdescription buries him or her in details and images. The trick is to find a happy medium. It’s also important to know what to describe and what can be left alone while you get on with your main job, which is telling a story.*

### Page 287 @ 04 May 2024 10:13:55 AM
*good description usually consists of a few well-chosen details that will stand for everything else. In most cases, these details will be the first ones that come to mind.*

### Page 287 @ 04 May 2024 10:14:11 AM
*You should remember (and your reading will prove it over and over again should you begin to doubt) that it’s as easy to overdescribe as to underdescribe. Probably easier.*

### Page 292 @ 04 May 2024 10:23:41 AM
*In many cases when a reader puts a story aside because it “got boring,” the boredom arose because the writer grew enchanted with his powers of description and lost sight of his priority, which is to keep the ball rolling.*

### Page 295 @ 04 May 2024 10:27:34 AM
*gained perhaps even more respect for the power of compact, descriptive language from reading T. S. Eliot (those ragged claws scuttling across the ocean floor; those coffee spoons*

### Page 309 @ 04 May 2024 10:44:31 AM
*cuntivore*

### Page 312 @ 04 May 2024 03:01:34 PM
*Some people don’t want to hear the truth, of course, but that’s not your problem. What would be is wanting to be a writer without wanting to shoot straight. Talk, whether ugly or beautiful, is an index of character; it can also be a breath of cool, refreshing air in a room some people would prefer to keep shut up.*

### Page 324 @ 05 May 2024 07:05:48 PM
*Skills in description, dialogue, and character development all boil down to seeing or hearing clearly and then transcribing what you see or hear with equal clarity (and without using a lot of tiresome, unnecessary adverbs).*

### Page 348 @ 05 May 2024 08:04:22 PM
*starting with the questions and thematic concerns is a recipe for bad fiction. Good fiction always begins with story and progresses to theme; it almost never begins with theme and progresses to story. The only possible exceptions to this rule that I can think of are allegories like George Orwell’s Animal Farm*

### Page 368 @ 09 May 2024 10:44:01 PM
*Call that one person you write for Ideal Reader. He or she is going to be in your writing room all the time: in the flesh once you open the door and let the world back in to shine on the bubble of your dream, in spirit during the sometimes troubling and often exhilarating days of the first draft, when the door is closed.*

### Page 375 @ 09 May 2024 10:51:28 PM
*You need to revise for length. Formula: 2nd Draft = 1st Draft - 10%. Good luck.”*

### Page 383 @ 12 May 2024 11:35:46 PM
*The most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn’t very interesting. Stick to the parts that are, and don’t get carried away with the rest.*

### Page 401 @ 12 May 2024 11:54:08 PM
*You learn best by reading a lot and writing a lot, and the most valuable lessons of all are the ones you teach yourself. These lessons almost always occur with the study door closed.*
