# Purpose
This is a digital garden. A digital garden is a place where knowledge accumulates. A place where one takes notes from various sources and distills them. Lets ideas grow like a plant would from a garden. Digital gardens have been growing in popularity in the indie internet for a good reason - they provide a way for knowledge to be better contextualised in other settings. 
In this vault, I will not only use the digital garden as a medium to practice my writing, I'll be using it to develop my [[./Areas/General/mental representations|mental representations]] of different topics I learn from literature, videos and podcasts. Not all of these notes will be complete. That is the nature of digital gardens. Notes are draft format. Some of the notes will become very polished which is what most digital gardeners call an "evergreen" note. However, these notes are going to be far and in between at this stage. This is because first I need to accumulate quite a bit of literature to rely on before I start consolidating into a longform article.

It may be conceited to believe that anyone would read it, hell, if anyone would even want to read this (who am I to be writing about things and to think they will read them). My hope is that as I get better at web development and accumulating ideas and references that I will inspire others. That I will spark creativity or interest in a topic that can be delved into deeper - all the resources will be right here! There is a lot of shit in this world: famine, poverty, war, pollution just to name a few, but we are also at a highly opportune time. We live in one of the most highly educated times of modern civilisation. An to top it all off, we live in a time where we have the resources to learn about whatever our heart's desire thanks to the internet. There are thousands of free resources and cheap books with plentiful knowledge out there for all kinds of interests. The problem is that with all these developments of technology, also comes distraction. The same tools that have given us the freedom to learn and acquire knowledge are also the things which distract us. 

We don't have much time on this world, so why not see and understand as much as we can. Try and open our minds up to various ideas and take in all that is out there. I hope that this digital garden, at its worst will be a place for me to develop my interests but at its best will inspire others to join in those interests and perhaps dive into it themselves.
# Inspiration
Some inspiration for this site and where i hope it to get to in terms of design and writing:
- Andy Matuschak - [see here](notes.andymatuschak.org)
- Gwern - [see here](gwern.net)
- Azlen Elza - [see here](azlen.me)
- less wrong blog - [see here](Lesswrong.com)
- 100 rabbits - [see here](100r.co)
# Design principles
In its early stages, this website will primarily be a representation of notes of my interests but as it develops, I intent it to be a learning and academic resource. Some things I will adhere to:
- Multiple jump in points - I want there to be multiple ways to jump into this website and learn something new. That's why there is a variety of ways to explore this site via tags, folders and maps of content. I hope that as the site grows, there will be others.
- Exportability - I want to implement ways of exporting the data from this website as pdf's, emailing newsletters on updates and other ways of taking the information into the reader's own hands. I don't want to lock any of the information from this site onto the site. I believe knowledge should be for everyone and should be as transportable and portable as possible.

## Bookshelf
My bookshelf contains notes from books where I've summarised its core ideas. It's where quotes and highlights I've taken from books are transformed into my own words and thoughts.

## Literature notes
Literature notes are the highlights and quotes that are extracted from my e-ink reader (Kobo Libra 2 running KoReader). When I highlight passages in a book, I highlight them because I want to remember some of that content or they seem important at the time. I don't always then use the ideas that I've highlighted in my book notes. A passage that seemed significant may not be upon rereading. When I've made a book note out of the literature notes, I mark it completed as indicated in the tables below:
