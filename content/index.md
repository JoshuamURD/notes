# Purpose
This is a digital garden. A digital garden is a place where knowledge accumulates. A place where one takes notes from various sources and distills them. Lets ideas grow like a plant would from a garden. Digital gardens have been growing in popularity in the indie internet for a good reason - they provide a way for knowledge to be better contextualised in other settings. 
In this vault, I will not only use the digital garden as a medium to practice my writing, I'll be using it to develop my [[mental representations|mental representations]] of different topics I learn from literature, videos and podcasts. Not all of these notes will be complete. That is the nature of digital gardens. Notes are draft format. Some of the notes will become very polished which is what most digital gardeners call an "evergreen" note. However, these notes are going to be far and in between at this stage. This is because first I need to accumulate quite a bit of literature to rely on before I start consolidating into a longform article.

## Bookshelf
My bookshelf contains notes from books where I've summarised its core ideas. It's where quotes and highlights I've taken from books are transformed into my own words and thoughts.
